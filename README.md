I found the original script here:

*It's a window switcher which shows the matching window titles as you type in your search string incrementally. If only one window is left it is activated immediately (configurable). Otherwise, you can type in more characters (or delete some with backspace) or select between the matching windows using cursor up/down/enter or you can cancel the window with esc.*

*You can use any substring of any window. For example, if you want to switch to word then you can type rd and there is a good chance word is selected immediately. Or type "notepad" and select quickly between the notepad windows with the cursor.*

*The idea comes from Emacs where it is used to switch between opened files. After a while it gets addictive, it's so efficient. At least it is my experience with emacs.*
